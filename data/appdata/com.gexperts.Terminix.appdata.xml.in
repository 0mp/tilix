  <summary>A tiling terminal for GNOME</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Terminix is a tiling terminal emulator.
    </p>
    <p>It lets you:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Layout terminals in any fashion by splitting them horizontally or vertically</li>
    <li>Terminals can be re-arranged using drag and drop both within and between windows</li>
    <li>Terminals can be detached into a new window via drag and drop</li>
    <li>Input can be synchronized between terminals so commands typed in one terminal are replicated to the others</li>
    <li>The grouping of terminals can be saved and loaded from disk</li>
    <li>Terminals support custom titles</li>
    <li>Color schemes are stored in files and custom color schemes can be created by simply creating a new file</li>
    <li>Transparent background</li>
    <li>Supports notifications when processes are completed out of view</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The application was written using GTK 3 and an effort was made to conform to
      GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG). As a result, it does use client-side-decorations, though it can be disabled if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>Terminix has been tested with GNOME and with Unity.</p>
